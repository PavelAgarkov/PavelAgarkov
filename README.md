# Hi there, I'm Pavel 👋

I'm a **Staff-level Go backend engineer** with 7+ years of professional experience (4+ focused on Go).  
I specialize in **distributed systems**, **in-memory databases**, and **high-performance services**.  
Currently working @ [Wildberries](https://github.com/wildberries-tech) in the WH-S AI division.
